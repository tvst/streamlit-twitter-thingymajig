A tweet analysis dashboard written in Streamlit!

To try it out, modify the `secrets.toml` file with your own Twitter API credentials. You can find
your credentials in the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal). In
there, you should create or select an existing project + app, then go to the app's "Keys and Tokens"
tab to generate your "Consumer Keys".
